Prompt:
We are testing various Text + Image to Image models and have found few open source images and some prompts that change the appearance, style, object, image, background, etc., We are planning to test the prompt consistency with the text prompt but we also want the metric to take into consideration the input image. Hence, we used a BLIP model to describe the image and add the text prompt to it.

 We want you to combine the image description, and the given 5 text prompts and produce a combined prompt for each of the prompts exactly describing the text alone. No need to add any additional description.
